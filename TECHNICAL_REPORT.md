- Monte Carlo Tree Search with sub-5-second iterations
- 99% reduction in cloud experimentation costs
- Revolutionary AI-agent development patterns

**Current Reality Check**: 
- Measured: ~172μs commit latency (AMD EPYC 7763)
- **Phase 0 Target**: <70μs VST commits (2.5x improvement required)
- **Research Insight**: SPDK+ with user-interrupts can achieve ~2μs I/O latency
