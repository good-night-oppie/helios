# Technical Report Revision Summary

## Critical Findings from Fact-Check

The deep-researcher agent, following DeepMind-style research protocols, identified several critical issues in the original technical report that required immediate correction:

### 1. Performance Claims Falsification
- **Original Claim**: 50μs snapshot operations
- **Actual Measurement**: 171,802ns (~172μs) 
- **Discrepancy**: 3.4x slower than claimed (not 3,440x as initially calculated - still microseconds, not milliseconds)
- **Action**: Updated all performance claims to match actual benchmarks

### 2. Non-Existent Evidence
- **Original**: References to `tests/bench_test.go:L47` and `tests/bench_test.go:L89`
- **Reality**: These files don't exist in the codebase
- **Action**: Removed false references, cited actual benchmark files

### 3. Test Coverage Overstatement
- **Original Claim**: 85% test coverage
- **Actual**: 77.2% for VST package, 3.8% for CLI
- **Action**: Corrected coverage numbers with per-package breakdown

### 4. Unsubstantiated Production Claims
- **Original**: "2.3 billion operations", "99.97% uptime"
- **Evidence**: No production monitoring or metrics found in code
- **Action**: Removed all unverifiable production claims

### 5. Missing Comparative Benchmarks
- **Original**: Claims about Redis (5ms) and PostgreSQL (10ms) performance
- **Evidence**: No comparative benchmarks in codebase
- **Action**: Removed unsubstantiated comparisons

### 6. Fabricated Example
- **Original**: Chess endgame example (167 minutes → 83 seconds)
- **Evidence**: No MCTS or chess implementation in codebase
- **Action**: Removed the example entirely

## Why These Changes Matter

### Credibility
- False performance claims undermine trust
- Non-existent file references damage technical credibility
- Unverifiable production metrics appear as marketing fluff

### Legal/Ethical
- Falsifiable claims could constitute misrepresentation
- Academic standards require evidence-based assertions
- Open source projects need transparency

### Technical Accuracy
- Developers need accurate benchmarks for decision-making
- Test coverage affects confidence in production readiness
- Real performance data enables proper capacity planning

## Revised Report Improvements

### Evidence-Based Approach
- All performance numbers from actual benchmark runs
- Test coverage from `go test -cover` output
- File references verified to exist

### Academic Rigor
- Added proper citations to MCTS research
- Included storage performance context from literature
- Acknowledged gaps in supporting research

### Honest Assessment
- Clearly marked as "Development" not "Production"
- Listed known issues and failing tests
- Included limitations section

### Maintainable Claims
- Performance numbers easily re-verified with benchmark commands
- Coverage metrics reproducible with standard Go tools
- No claims requiring external validation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify benchmarks** before publishing performance claims
2. **Use actual measurements** not theoretical best-cases
3. **Include reproduction steps** for all metrics
4. **Acknowledge limitations** to build trust
5. **Cite real evidence** not imaginary files

## Recommendation

Replace the original TECHNICAL_REPORT.md with TECHNICAL_REPORT_REVISED.md immediately to:
- Prevent reputational damage from false claims
- Provide developers with accurate information
- Maintain academic and professional integrity
- Build trust through transparency

The revised report is less impressive but more honest - and that honesty will ultimately serve the project better than inflated claims.
