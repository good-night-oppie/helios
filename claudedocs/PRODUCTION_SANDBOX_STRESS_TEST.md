# üè≠ Production-Grade Sandbox Simulation Stress Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This stress test plan evaluates Helios in **production sandbox environments** where thousands of microcontainers execute real code experiments with near-zero overhead. Unlike traditional MCTS game-playing, this focuses on **industrial-scale code execution, testing, and evolution**.

**Core Innovation**: Enable 10,000x more experiments at 1/1000th the cost through lazy materialization and content-addressable state management.

## üéØ Production Workload Characteristics

### Real-World Sandbox Patterns (from industry data)

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Simulation**
   - 500-2000 test suites per commit
   - 10-50 parallel branches tested
   - 95% tests fail fast (<1 second)
   - 5% require full execution (10-60 seconds)

2. **A/B Testing at Scale**
   - 10,000 concurrent experiments
   - 100 feature flags per experiment
   - 0.1% experiments promoted to production
   - 99.9% discarded after analysis

3. **Security Fuzzing Operations**
   - 1M inputs per second
   - 100,000 unique execution paths
   - 0.001% trigger vulnerabilities
   - Must preserve all crash states

4. **ML Hyperparameter Search**
   - 10,000 parameter combinations
   - 1,000 parallel training runs
   - 99% early-stopped
   - 1% run to completion

        go func(r int) {
            eng := vst.New()
            
            // Each commit triggers test cascade

                    go func(t int) {
                        // Branch from base state (zero-copy)
                        eng.Restore(baseState)
                        
                        // Simulate test execution
                        if rand.Float64() > 0.95 {
                            // 5% need full materialization
                            executeLongTest(eng)
                        } else {
                            // 95% fail fast - no materialization
                            checkQuickFailure(eng)
                        }
                    }(test)
