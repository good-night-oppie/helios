# Storage System Implementation Review

**Task**: ${TASK_ID} - ${TASK_TITLE}  
**Complexity**: ${COMPLEXITY}/10  
**Implementation**: ${IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY}

## Review Focus: Storage & Persistence

### 1. **Specification Compliance**
Analyze this storage implementation against the ${SPEC_DOCUMENT} specifications:

#### Performance Requirements
- **Target Latency**: ${TARGET_LATENCY}
- **Achieved Latency**: ${ACHIEVED_LATENCY}
- **Throughput Target**: ${TARGET_THROUGHPUT}
- **Achieved Throughput**: ${ACHIEVED_THROUGHPUT}

#### Data Integrity
- [ ] ACID compliance verification
- [ ] Crash recovery testing
- [ ] Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) implementation
- [ ] Atomicity of batch operations
- [ ] Consistency under concurrent access

### 2. **Critical Architecture Evaluation**

#### Storage Engine Decision
**Original Spec**: ${ORIGINAL_STORAGE_ENGINE}  
**Implemented**: ${ACTUAL_STORAGE_ENGINE}  
**Justification**: ${ENGINE_SWITCH_REASON}

As a world-class distributed systems expert, critically evaluate:
1. **Trade-offs Made**:
   - What capabilities were gained?
   - What features were lost?
   - Was this a pragmatic improvement or a compromise?

2. **Performance Impact**:
   - Benchmark data: ${BENCHMARK_RESULTS}
   - Memory usage comparison
   - I/O patterns analysis
   - Compaction behavior

3. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Deployment complexity change
   - Monitoring/debugging capabilities
   - Backup/restore procedures
   - Upgrade path implications

### 3. **Implementation Quality Assessment**

#### Code Review Focus
- **Error Handling**: How are storage failures handled?
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling, file handles, memory
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety, deadlock prevention
- **Testing**: Property-based tests for invariants

#### Specific Storage Concerns
1. **Data Corruption Prevention**:
   ```
   - Checksums/integrity verification?
   - Partial write handling?
   - Power failure resilience?
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```
   - Batch size tuning
   - Cache configuration
   - Compression settings
   - Index optimization
   ```

3. **Scalability Factors**:
   ```
   - Maximum database size tested
   - Performance degradation curve
   - Compaction impact on latency
   ```

### 4. **Alternative Implementation**

If you identify critical issues, provide a COMPLETE alternative implementation plan:

```go
// Your alternative implementation approach
type AlternativeStore struct {
    // Complete structure definition
}

// Key methods that would differ
func (s *AlternativeStore) MethodName() {
    // Implementation
}
```

### 5. **Risk Assessment**

| Risk Category | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Data Loss | ? | ? |
| Performance Degradation | ? | ? |
| Operational Complexity | ? | ? |
| Migration Difficulty | ? | ? |

### 6. **Specific Questions for Task ${TASK_ID}**

Based on the implementation details:

1. **Snapshot Support**: How does the snapshot mechanism ensure consistency during concurrent writes?

2. **Metadata Separation**: The `meta:` prefix approach vs column families - quantify the performance impact?

3. **Crash Recovery**: What's the worst-case recovery time for a 1TB database?

4. **Backpressure**: How does the system behave when L2 storage can't keep up with L0/L1 throughput?

5. **Testing Coverage**: Were chaos engineering tests performed? Results?

### 7. **Required Evidence**

Please provide:
- [ ] Benchmark comparison: Original spec vs implemented solution
- [ ] Crash recovery test results (minimum 1000 scenarios)
- [ ] Memory profile under load
- [ ] Latency histogram (P50, P95, P99, P99.9)
- [ ] Compaction impact measurements

### 8. **Decision Framework**

**APPROVE if**:
- All performance targets met consistently
- No data integrity concerns
- Acceptable operational trade-offs
- Clear migration path

**REQUEST CHANGES if**:
- Performance targets missed by >10%
- Data integrity risks identified
- Unacceptable operational complexity
- No clear rollback strategy

**ESCALATE if**:
- Fundamental architecture concerns
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss potential
- Multiple critical issues
