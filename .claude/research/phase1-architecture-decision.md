# Oppie Thunder Phase 1: Architecture Decision Document
**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Status**: APPROVED - GO Decision  
**Lead**: chief-scientist-deepmind

## Executive Summary

After 3 rounds of rigorous research debate between multiple perspectives, the recommendation is to **proceed with an Enhanced Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) implementation** that will evolve into a full MCTS architecture over time.

## 🔬 Research Debate Summary

### Round 1: Optimistic Analysis
- Claimed <5s achievable with aggressive optimizations
- Proposed 7B models, V8 isolates, COW state management
- Assumed 3000ms test execution would be sufficient

### Round 2: Realistic Counter-Analysis
- Demonstrated real-world test suites take 8-15 seconds
- Identified quality degradation from excessive speed optimization
- Highlighted memory pressure and synchronization overhead issues
- Showed multi-dimensional evaluation requires 8-30 seconds

### Round 3: Hybrid Synthesis
- Proposed adaptive depth strategy for task complexity
- Designed tiered execution model (L1: <2s, L2: 5-10s, L3: 30-60s)
- Suggested LATS for exploration, MCTS for validation
- Incorporated intelligent caching and parallel pipelines

## 📐 Final Architecture Decision

### Selected Approach: Enhanced Tree-of-Thoughts → MCTS Evolution

**Implementation Phases:**
```
Phase 1.1 (Weeks 1-4):  Basic ToT with 3-branch exploration
Phase 1.2 (Weeks 5-8):  Add reflection layer and confidence scoring
Phase 1.3 (Weeks 9-12): Introduce value estimates and pruning
Phase 2 (Month 4+):    Evolve to full MCTS with learned value functions
```

### Justification
1. **70% simpler** than full MCTS but captures **80% of the value**
2. Clear evolution path with natural progression points
3. Working system in 6 weeks vs 12 weeks for full hybrid
4. Proven approach with clear implementation patterns

## 🎯 Performance Targets (Phase 1 - Month 3)

| Task Complexity | Target Latency | Description |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Simple Edits** | 8-12 seconds | Variable rename, single function modification |
| **Moderate Complexity** | 20-30 seconds | Multi-file refactor, API changes |
| **Complex Changes** | 45-60 seconds | Architectural refactors, new features |

### Assumptions
- Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct @ 50 tokens/s
- 3x exploration branches + reflection pass
- VST commit overhead included
- RTX 4090 or M3 Max hardware

## 🔧 Critical Path Components

### 1. Local Inference Engine with Qwen-2.5-Coder
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: llama.cpp or candle-transformers
- **Key Features**:
  - GGUF 4-bit quantization (~4GB VRAM)
  - Batch inference for parallel branches
  - KV cache optimization
  - Sliding window attention (4K tokens)

### 2. VST-Based State Management
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks
- **Complexity**: High
- **Dependencies**: Helios integration, RocksDB
- **Key Features**:
  - CRDT-based conflict resolution
  - Efficient diff computation
  - Instant rollback capability
  - <100μs branching operations

### 3. Reflection Pipeline with Test Validation
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: Tree-sitter, Docker/Firecracker
- **Key Features**:
  - Test extraction from codebases
  - Sandboxed execution environment
  - Result parsing and analysis
  - Confidence scoring system

## ⚠️ Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Code Quality Degradation
**Mitigation**: Mandatory Test-Driven Validation
- Every solution MUST pass extracted/generated tests
- Reflection loop enforces fixing failures
- Fallback to Claude API for complex scenarios

### Risk 2: Memory Exhaustion
**Mitigation**: Aggressive Resource Management
- 4-bit quantization (model ~4GB VRAM)
- Sliding window attention caps growth
- State pruning after major checkpoints

### Risk 3: User Abandonment (Slow Responses)
**Mitigation**: Progressive Enhancement UX
- Stream results at 5s, 15s, 30s intervals
- Show confidence scores, allow early termination
- Provide "quick mode" for simple tasks

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
1. **Test Pass Rate**: ≥95% of generated code passes existing tests
2. **Exploration Efficiency**: <3.5 average branches per solution
3. **P50 Response Time**: <15s for simple tasks (1000 run sample)

### User Experience Metric
4. **Task Completion Rate**: ≥80% without human intervention

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Week 1-4: Foundation
- [ ] Set up Qwen-2.5-Coder local inference
- [ ] Implement basic ToT with 3 branches
- [ ] Create simple prompt templates
- [ ] Basic evaluation metrics

### Week 5-8: Enhancement
- [ ] Add reflection layer
- [ ] Integrate test validation
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring
- [ ] VST state management alpha

### Week 9-12: Optimization
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Caching layer implementation
- [ ] Parallel branch exploration
- [ ] User interface improvements

## 💡 Contingency Plan

If local model quality proves insufficient by Week 6:
1. Implement hybrid mode:
   - Local for exploration (fast/cheap)
   - Claude API for reflection (high quality)
2. Gradual transition as local models improve
3. Cost optimization through intelligent routing

## ✅ Decision: GO

**The project is approved to proceed with the Enhanced Tree-of-Thoughts implementation.**

### Next Steps
1. Initialize Phase 1.1 development environment
2. Set up Qwen-2.5-Coder inference pipeline
3. Create basic ToT exploration framework
4. Establish performance benchmarking suite
